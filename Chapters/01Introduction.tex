\subsection{Work structure}
Since our project contains parts initially unrelated to each other, we decided to split the work into three main categories. Every team member individually focused on owned part and then we join them together. \\
The work division can be summarized as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mobile Application - Filip Bończyk
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Designing mobile application in Flutter
            \item Client-server stream testing 
            \item Creating docker containers
        \end{itemize}
    \item Server - Bartosz Sobkowiak
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Development of server in WebRTC standard
            \item Preparing mechanism of frame catching and passing to the CNN
            \item Server deploying
        \end{itemize}
    \item Nerual Network - Kamil Burdziński, Joanna Świda
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Related works research
            \item Project structure design
            \item Optimization of image processing algorithm
            \item Network retraining
            \item Network testing and accelerating
            \item Binding server and algorithm together
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
