\subsection{Motivation}
The recent innovations in the field of neural networks created new possibilities in the domain of video and image processing. The neural style transfer (NST) introduced by \bartek{dodac Gatysa} enables rendering image with its own content but a style of another one. Various papers present improvements of this concept - enhancement of artistic stylization effects, computational speed or content-style distribution. However, the NST approach is still fresh and further improvements could be done. We find that there still is a lack in the real-time video processing area, as well as easy access for non-skilled users. Even the latest works we base on provide algorithms that are not fast enough for high-resolution processing, neither for processing on average architectures. The shortage of availability of free and easy-to-use applications or platforms is also noticeable.


\subsection{Project objective}
The overall objective of our thesis was to enable fast real-time video processing using artistic style transfer by speeding up the existing convolutional neural network and ensure easy access by mobile application and lightweight server.

We aimed to maintain good video quality (1024x576) while reducing the computational time by use of network pruning and TensorRT. The speedup had to go hand in hand with video stability and color preservation although we did not want to depend on the sophisticated architecture. Moreover, we attempted to achieve a movie-like frame speed (\textasciitilde24 FPS) without limiting the number of possible styles.

Access to our program should be provided for anyone interested - especially for those without programming skills. Therefore designing a user-friendly and cross-platform mobile application was the second goal. And since we focus on the video quality, the server should seamlessly connect application and algorithm - from any place without delays.

\subsection{Work structure}
Since our project contains parts initially unrelated to each other, we decided to split the work into three main categories. Every team member individually focused on an owned part and then we join them together. \\
The work division can be summarized as follows:
