\subsection{Motivation}
\todo[inline]{Rewrite the motivation - at the end}
The evolution of technology has taken humanity to heights like never before. Work areas of medicine, safety, learning, and providing other kinds of help has reached a peak. But it does not stop there. Artificial intelligence is the next big thing in the world of technology and computer science but to understand it, it’s important to know what it consists of. It is essential to know what is deep learning and what artificial neural network means.

The AI technology field is extremely advanced and interesting. These two tools that are being used in artificial intelligence are very powerful in terms of solving complex problems and to develop even higher standards in science.

\subsection{Work structure}
Since our project contains parts initially unrelated to each other, we decided to split the work into three main categories. Every team member individually focused on an owned part and then we join them together. \\
The work division can be summarized as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mobile Application - Filip Bończyk
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Designing mobile application in Flutter
            \item Client-server stream testing 
            \item Creating docker containers
        \end{itemize}
    \item Server - Bartosz Sobkowiak
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Development of server in WebRTC standard
            \item Preparing mechanism of frame catching and passing to the CNN
            \item Server deploying
        \end{itemize}
    \item Nerual Network - Kamil Burdziński, Joanna Świda
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Related works research
            \item Project structure design
            \item Optimization of image processing algorithm
            \item Network retraining
            \item Network testing and accelerating
            \item Binding server and algorithm together
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
