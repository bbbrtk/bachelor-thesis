We consider style transfer algorithm for processing video. 
To improve available algorithm, we focus on minimizing inference time by
network pruning and use of specialized inference libraries. We arrive at an algorithm, 
which runs with satisfying resolution of images in real time even on older
NVIDIA 900 series GPUs. For client we prepare mobile application and server to communication.
